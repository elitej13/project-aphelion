# Project Aphelion

*Warning - this is still in initial stages of development and needs a lot of work to just maintain a semblance of functionality.

Just your everyday generic 2D RPG engine! Using LibGDX open-source framework.
Build at your own risk, source code is functioning as of now using Eclipse.
The Gradle dependency management seems to build okay, but no testing has
been done outside of the native IDE (Eclipse). Current Android build is broken,
the GWT framework has not been tested since initial run but seems to build properly,
and I don't have a Mac so nothing has been tested for iOS using RoboVM.
