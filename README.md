# About Project Necro Hero
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/euthyphro666/project-aphelion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/euthyphro666/project-aphelion)

Project Necro Hero is a topdown 2D (for now maybe) rpg engine that aspires to one day be its own game. I am a university student soloing this project partly to help build up my portfolio, but mostly becuase I love programming and I definitely love video games. If you have any desire to add to or just advise the creation of this project please email me at joshhess13@gmail.com!

Thanks for stopping by!
