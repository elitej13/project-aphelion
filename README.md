# About Project Aphelion
Project Aphelion is a topdown 2D (for now maybe) rpg engine that aspires to one day be its own game.
I am a university student soloing this project partly to help build up my portfolio, but mostly
becuase I love programming and I definitely love video games. If you have any incling or desire
to add to or just advise the creation of this project please email me at joshhess13@gmail.com!
Thanks for stopping by!
